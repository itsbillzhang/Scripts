# Scripts
These are some scripts I've put together:

**[Webchange Script](https://github.com/itsbillzhang/Scripts/blob/master/Webchange%20Script.py)** (05/15/2020)

Refreshes a website every 30 seconds using different user agents. When a change is detected in the HTML, an email is immediately sent out. I used this to get into CS246 when CS course reserves opened, so I could register immediately.
